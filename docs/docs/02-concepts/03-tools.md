# Tools

Tools define an agent's capabilities and determine how it interacts with the world. Acorn includes a wide range of built-in tools. To help illustrate what tools can do, here are a few examples:
- Creating email drafts
- Sending Slack messages
- Retrieving the contents of a web page

The **Tools** page displays all built-in tools available in Acorn, along with any custom tools you've added. The built-in tools are open source and can be accessed [here](https://github.com/acorn-io/tools).

For instructions on creating your own tools, refer to our [Tool Authoring Guide](/tools/first-tool).
