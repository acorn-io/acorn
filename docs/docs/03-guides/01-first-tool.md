# Writing your First Tool
This should be a brief guide that shows how to write a simple "hello world" type tool. It would be good to show the tool doing something dynamic like generating a random number or returning the current date time.

I'd like us to have repos for each supported language and a version of the tool in each language. You can link to the repo in this guide and assume the user knows how to code and use github.

SHow the basic layout of a tool (keep the code as simple as possible). Show a tool.gpt. Show the metadata stuff for category and image.

Highlight that the tool needs to be pushed to github and then registered in the ui and end with explaining how it can then be added to an agent.
